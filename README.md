LAIRS and SentiNet form a local-first, human-governed AI platform that combines persistent memory, model orchestration, and zero-trust networking so powerful intelligence can run securely inside infrastructure you control.

# LAIRS & SentiNet by Aegis Secure Convergence Systems

LAIRS and SentiNet together form a local-first, human-governed artificial intelligence platform designed to run powerful, persistent, and secure machine intelligence inside infrastructure you control.

This project defines the architecture, governance, and design philosophy behind a new class of AI systems that are:

powerful without being autonomous

intelligent without being ungovernable

and useful without surrendering human authority

# What is LAIRS?

LAIRS (Local Artificial Intelligence Reasoning System) is the cognitive runtime of the platform.

It provides:

persistent memory

identity and state

model orchestration

tool execution

and policy-controlled action

LAIRS treats AI models as cognitive engines, not decision-makers.
Models can reason, analyze, and propose actions — but all critical changes and system modifications remain under human control.

# What is SentiNet?

SentiNet is the secure networking and governance fabric that surrounds LAIRS.

It provides:

default-deny network segmentation

internal DNS and PKI

encrypted service-to-service identity

controlled ingress and egress

and zone-based trust boundaries

SentiNet ensures that AI systems operate inside a cryptographically enforced, zero-trust environment, rather than as free-roaming software.

# Sentinel Modules

The platform is extended through a family of Sentinel modules that plug into both LAIRS and SentiNet:

Module	Purpose:

Sentinel Watchdog	System: integrity, telemetry, and anomaly detection

Sentinel Gate	Network: policy, and access control enforcement

Sentinel AV:	File and behavior scanning

Sentinel Forge:	Patch generation and upgrade advisory system (human-approved only)

Each module is designed to be:

auditable

policy-bound

and subordinate to human governance

# Core Principles

The entire platform is built around five invariants:

Human Root Authority
A human is always the final authority over system changes.

Local-First Intelligence
All data, memory, and computation reside on infrastructure you control.

No Autonomous Self-Modification
AI may propose changes, but cannot apply them without cryptographic human approval.

Auditability & Transparency
Every action, decision, and modification is logged and verifiable.

Security by Architecture
Identity, policy, and encryption are part of the system itself, not add-ons.

# Why This Exists

Modern AI is centralized, opaque, and unaccountable.

LAIRS and SentiNet exist to make it possible to deploy powerful AI in:

secure networks

air-gapped environments

enterprises

critical infrastructure

research labs

and government systems

…without surrendering:

data ownership

decision authority

or operational safety


# This Repository

This repository contains the open architecture and design for the LAIRS & SentiNet platform:

system layout

governance rules

security model

and integration philosophy

It does not contain:

production code

cryptographic keys

or deployable binaries

Those are maintained separately under controlled licensing.
